Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Codebook for my_tidydata_assignment

The dataset for this project is called Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set and was obtained here:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#.  The experiment used to gather the data include 30 volunteers broken into two groups:
1. 70% generating "training" data
2. 30% generating "test"data

The project requirement was to combine the "training" and "test" data into a single dataset, then make the file somewhat human readable by providing meaningful column names.  Also required was that only mean and standard deviation data be in the resultant set.  The resultant dataset is called my_tidydata.txt.  

Here is a description of the variables in the resulting dataset, my_tidydata.txt, afer processing with my R scripts called 'run_analysis.R':
